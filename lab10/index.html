	<h1> Lab 10: Javascript for the Web </h1>


	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p>Challenges for this lab was using the getElementById function and the appendchild function
		I researched how to use these in an html file and was able to connect the js file.</p>
	<h2>Problems </h2>
	<p>Problems that I faced was accidentally not capitalizing the b in the getElementById function
		and I spent a couple minutes realizing my mistake.  </p>
	<h2>Results </h2>
	<p>Here are the results of the code that I used for my index.html file. The js code is
	printed on the bottom, it says random text.</p>
	<div id = "duh">
	<button type = "sortUserName()">button </button>
</div>
	<div id = "output">
