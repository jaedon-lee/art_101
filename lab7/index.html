	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p>Challenges for this lab was getting the js file to work properly because I never implemented the window.prompt
		before and it was interesting to see how the results worked on an html file.</p>
	<h2>Problems </h2>
	<p>Problems that I faced was not knowing what was the problem in my js file but it was just the commas missing.  </p>
	<h2>Results </h2>
	<p>Here are the results of the code that I put inside of the js file as well
	as my script output you see below. </p>
	<div>
		<h2>Script Output </h2>
